In every academic institution, class scheduling is one of the most essential but time-
consuming and error-prone tasks. The goal of our project is to design and implement a
Conflict-Free Class Scheduler that automatically allocates time slots, rooms, and teach-
ers to courses based on various constraints. This project uses backtracking (similar to
N-Queen logic) to ensure that no course, room, or teacher overlaps in a way that causes
conflicts. Our system also features a user-friendly graphical interface that allows users
to generate schedules from CSV files without writing code.
